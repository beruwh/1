#Q.1 1. Given 10 datapoints with mean = 2, assume that the data is Exponential(lambda)
#i.  Compute the MLE for lambda
#ii. Write a R code to generate 5000 parametric bootstrap samples each of size 10.
#iii.Compute the bootstrap means and bootstrap difference.

#ANS:
n = 10
xbar = 2

# MLE for xbar is 1/xbar
lambda_hat = 1/xbar

nboot = 5000
x = rexp(n*nboot, lambda_hat)

head(bootstrap_sample)
length(x)
dim
dim(bootstrap_sample) # here 10x5000 means each col is of size 10 and which is the pair to be drawn

#ii)Compute the bootstrap means
# BECAUSE EACH COL HAS ONE BOOTSTRAP SAMPLE SO WE ARE FINDING THE LAMBDASTAR AS MEAN
#(here we are calculating mean)
boot_mean = apply(bootstrap_sample,2,mean) # here 2 is for col
length(boot_mean)

#iii)
# compute the bootstrap lambda_star (here we are calculating lambda)
lambda_star = 1/colMeans(bootstrap_sample)

deltastar = lambda_star-lambda_hat
