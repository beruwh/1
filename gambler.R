#Q.6:A reluctant gambler is dragged to the riverboat casino by his more free-willing friends. He only 
#takes $50 to gamble. Since he does not know much about gambling, he decides to play roulette. 
#At each spin, he places $25 on red. If red occurs, he wins $ 25. If black occurs, he loses his $25. 
#Therefore, the odds of winning are 50% (itâ€™s lower in the actual game).  He will quit playing if he 
#either has zero money left or is up by $25 ($75 total). Model this process as a Markov chain. Find 
#the probability that the gambler breaks at 3rd turn. Also, examine its long-run behavior.
